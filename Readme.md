# Memory Manager Simulation

A simple memory manager simulation program that demonstrates memory allocation and deallocation using different allocation strategies: first-fit, best-fit, next-fit, and worst-fit.

## Introduction

This project simulates a memory manager using various allocation strategies: first-fit, best-fit, next-fit, and worst-fit. It allocates and deallocates memory blocks for different processes, showcasing the state of memory after each operation.

## Features

- Memory allocation using different strategies: first-fit, best-fit, next-fit, worst-fit.
- Displaying the state of memory after each allocation or deallocation.
- Simple and easy-to-understand simulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Make utility

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Change into the project directory:
    cd MemoryManager

3. build the target executables
    make all


### Usage
./output/firstfit
./output/bestfit
./output/nextfit
./output/worstfit

### Input
    Input can be given in input/req.txt

    input format:
    process_size_1 execution_time_1
    process_size_2 execution_time_2
    process_size_3 execution_time_3
